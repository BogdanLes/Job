# Job
Project Job is a website that can store a catalogue of jobs(websites under development) so that they can be easily access from one single webpage.

In it i've tried incorporating the following operations without leaving the webpage:
- listing all available jobs
- adding a new job

The second purpose was to test:
- simplexml
- classes (staic methods, constructor ...)
- AJAX and JSON
